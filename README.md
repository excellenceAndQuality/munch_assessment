Roy Langa Munch assessment

## Getting Started

Hello, this is my munch assignmet, when I built the project I only selected ios and android, I unchecked Linux, Windows and Web.

These are my SDK versions:
Flutter 3.7.12 • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Dart SDK version: 2.19.6 (stable) (Tue Mar 28 13:41:04 2023 +0000) on "macos_x64"

I added a snackbar after you select a user just so that it can show you the password, 
I've implemented this for testing purposes.
